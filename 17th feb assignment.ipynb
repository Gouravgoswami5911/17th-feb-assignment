    "features that make it well-suited for modern, high-performance applications. Here are some of the most important features of \n",
    "MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-oriented: MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, which can contain nested structures and arrays. This makes it\n",
    "    easy to store complex, unstructured data and query it in a flexible way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible schema: MongoDB allows for flexible and dynamic schema design, meaning that you can change the structure of your data\n",
    "    at any time without having to modify the entire database.\n",
    "\n",
    "High performance: MongoDB is designed to be fast and efficient, with support for in-memory computing, distributed architectures,\n",
    "    and automatic sharding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal scaling: MongoDB is designed to be horizontally scalable, which means that you can add more servers to handle \n",
    "    increased load without having to change your application code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing: MongoDB supports a variety of indexing options, including compound indexes and text search indexes, which can greatly\n",
    "    improve query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich query language: MongoDB offers a rich query language that includes support for ad-hoc queries, aggregation pipelines, and\n",
    "    geospatial queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic failover: MongoDB includes built-in support for automatic failover and replication, which means that your data is \n",
    "    always available even in the event of a server failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open source: MongoDB is open source, meaning that it is free to use and has a large and active developer community that \n",
    "    contributes to its ongoing development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, MongoDB's features make it a great choice for modern, high-performance applications that require flexibility, \n",
